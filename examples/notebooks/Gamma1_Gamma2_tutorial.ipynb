    "# Vortex dynamics analysis with Γ1 and Γ2 functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Γ1 and Γ2 functions were introduced in L.Graftieaux, M. Michard, N. Grosjean, \"Combining PIV, POD and vortex identification algorithms for the study of unsteady turbulent swirling flows\", Meas.Sci.Technol., 12(2001), p.1422-1429. Γ1 function is used to identify the locations of the centers of the vortices (which are given by the Γ1 peak values within the velocity field). Γ2 function is used to identify the boundaries of the vortices in a velocity field.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are implemented in PIVPY package, specifically, for big datasets. To compute them, one must apply their formulas in a neigborhood of every velocity vector within the velocity field. The results of the formulas are scalars wich are assigned to the position of the given velocity vector. And we end up having Γ1 and Γ2 scalar fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "PIVPY stores time series of velocity fields as piv objects (which are extensions of Xarray class). The Γ1 and Γ2 formulas for a neigborhoud of the velocity vector are implemented in the functions `Γ1_moving_window_function()` and `Γ2_moving_window_function()` located in `compute_funcs.py` module of PIVPY package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods of piv class `Γ1()` and `Γ2()` start with \"constructing\" a \"rolling (or moving) window\" which has the user-picked size of the neighborhood of every velocity vector and goes from one velocity vector to another applying `Γ1_moving_window_function()` and `Γ2_moving_window_function()` to its neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Γ1()` and `Γ2()` methods do that in parallel. They break the entier dataset of velocity fields on chunks using Dask-inspired function `.map_blocks()` and perform the above described calculations for every chunk in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon extensive testing, this design was proven to be the fastest one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, it is not fast for small datasets because the mechanism of Dask is known to become fast only for big datasets and it, actually, slows down the calculations for small datasets. Thus - during the tests - it was discovered that a small dataset of $10$ velocity fields would take on the order of $800s$ to compute Γ1, whereas a big dataset of $500$ velocity fields would take on the order of $2400s$ to compute Γ1. I.e., the computing time increased only by the factor of $3$ whereas the dataset increased by the factor of $50$. The gains in speed are anticipated to be even better when the dataset increases even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note, that Jupiter notebook takes more computing time than a regular console-based python programme for the same task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses only two velocity fields, because, otherwise, it would take a lot of time to obtain Γ1 and Γ2 fields."

    "\n",
    "Another thing one can do with them is to obtain the coordinates of the centers of the vortices and their sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus per the referenced article, Γ1 values must reach maximum at the vortex center. On the above plots of Γ1, we can see the maximum positive (presumably counter clockwise vortex) and negative (presumably clockwise vortex) values to be between about $-0.9$ and $0.7$. One can apply a treshold of, say, $20\\%$ and claim that the centers of the vortices are located in the areas where |Γ1| > 0.8*|Γ1|.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same thing can be done with Γ2. The referenced article offers a threshold of $2\\pi$ for the boundaries of the vortices. It \"defines the inner core of the vortex as the part of the flow where |Γ2| exceeds a given threshold, typically in the range $0.6-0.7$ (approximately $2\\pi$).\" Another piece of knowledge the referenced article gives us is that for |Γ2|<$2\\pi$ the flow is dominated by strain locally, for |Γ2|=$2\\pi$ the flow is a pure shear flow locally and for |Γ2|>$2\\pi$ the flow is dominated by rotation locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it was mentioned in the preamble to this example, we are looking at bubble driven vertical flow along an inclined wall. Those right hand sides of the plots with absolutely uniform colors represent the wall. There is no flow there and, therefore, our $\\Gamma 1$ and $\\Gamma 2$ functions found no vortices there. However, we can see primarily red inclined stretch in the middle of the plots. This is the wall along which the bubbles are rising in chain and creating swirls in the water. The colors are rich there - we have strong swirls there. At the left most vertical edge of the plots we see primarily blue and yellow colors, which according to the colorbars, correspond to positive vortices. It so happens that the left most edge of the plots coincide with the wall of the vessel where this flow occurs. There are no bubbles rising alon that wall. So, you may conclude now that the strongest vortices appear on the walls (where the largest shear occurs) and the vortices on the opposite walls \"spin\" in the opposite directions. And since the bubbles are rising in chain only along the right wall (i.e., the inclined wall), the vortices are much \"stronger\" there than along the left vertical wall."

In turn, $\\Gamma 2$ - in spite of giving us the suggested threshold of $2\\pi = 0.6$ - doesn't show a visually well defined boundary of the vortex (as opposed to case A, where, visually, the boundary of the vortex is obvious). And the last thing to notice is that the vortex in case B is blue, whereas the vortex in case A is red. Have a look at the color bars and you will notice that positive values lean toward the blue end of the colorbar, whereas negative values lean toward the red end of the colorbar. I.e., if the vortex is blue it's, presumably, counter clockwise (i.e., obeys the right hand rule) and if the the vortex is red it's, presumably, clock wise.
