PIVPy introduction
=========================

----------------------
History and motivation
----------------------


PIVPy is inspired by Federic Moisy Matlab package, called PIVMAT http://www.fast.u-psud.fr/pivmat/


Futhermore, although OpenPIV is our main PIV analysis tool, we work with multiple software vendors in 
our research projects, TSI, Lavision, Dantec, PIVLab, etc. PIVPy, like PIVMAT is reading all these
files and unifies the post-processing. The main underlying Python packages are: 
- xarray
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- jupyter
