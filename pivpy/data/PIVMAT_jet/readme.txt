This directory contains 3 velocity fields in the Davis 7 format (*.VC7).
These velocity fields have been obtained from a 12 m/s air jet
with a diameter of 15 cm. The flow is seeded by 11 microns hollow glass
spheres (Sphericel), and lighted by a pulsed 25 mJ Yag laser.
Pictures are taken with a 2048x2048 14 bits camera (ImagerProPlus),
imaging a vertical plane of dimension 23x23 cm, using an interframe
time of 40 microseconds. Velocity fields have been computed using
interrogation windows of size 32x32 pixels, 50% overlap. A triangular
zone on the bottom left has not been computed due to insufficient
lighting.
