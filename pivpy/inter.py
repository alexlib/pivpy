    "vf" in the name of the function stands for VortexFitting package.
    The function takes PIVPY data base object and converts it to an object of class
    VelocityField from VortexFitting package. We are interested only in the velocity 
    field portion of the PIVPY database because this is what VortexFitting's 
    VelocityField class is concerned about.
    There is no way to to convert PIVPY database to vortexfitting.VelocityField
    without creating a file because the later wants a file to read from.
    I wanted to create a hidden file, but that's a pain if we try doing it
    cross-platform. For now, I'm just going to create a normal file and leave
    it to the user to decide what to do with it when the analysis is done. A user
    must supply the name of the file.
    Parameters: field (xarray.DataSet) - PIVPY ofject - an Xarray data set - that contains
                                         velocity field; it may contain other para-
                                         meters (e.g. vorticity), but it doesn't 
                                         matter; it must contain only one time frame.
                ncFilePath (pathlib.Path) - a path to the .nc file that will store
                                            the velocity field that will be fed to 
                                            VortexFitting; an example of the file name
                                            is PIVpair1VelocityField.nc; note the file
                                            doesn't have to exist - the function just
                                            needs a name for the file
    Returns: vfield (vortexfitting.VelocityField) - object of the VortexFitting
                                                    package class VelocityField
